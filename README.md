# MachineLearn
Some machine learning staff on php:)

It just an example of using one perceptrone and learning it to find the right number.
For an input I used only 1 or 0 like black/white color. 
each picture has 3*5
the boundary to except the pixel like 1 is 6, but you can change it whatever you want to change the learning of function
